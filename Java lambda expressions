Java lambda expressions have many real-life applications such as:

Event handling: Java lambda expressions are used to handle button clicks, mouse events, etc. in GUI applications.

Collection processing: Java lambda expressions are used to process collections of data, for example, filtering, sorting, mapping, etc.

Concurrent programming: Java lambda expressions are used to perform parallel processing, for example, using the Streams API in Java 8.

RESTful web services: Java lambda expressions are used to handle incoming requests and generate responses in RESTful web services.

Reactive programming: Java lambda expressions are used to implement reactive programming patterns, for example, using the Reactive Streams API in Java 9.

Microservices: Java lambda expressions are used to implement individual microservices that are part of a larger application.
